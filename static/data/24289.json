First of all I have to tell you however, that I <i>never</i> received yr pamphlet. I enquired here &amp; the P.O. Authorities sent a man round, who told me that most likely the book has been returned to A'dam. You have roused my curiosity &amp; <i>must</i> absolutely send me another copy at <i>once.</i><b> ¶</b><i>Next</i>. I don't know whether you ever read the 19th Century. If not get the number for <i>May</i> &amp; there you will find a most interesting article on the authorship of Shakespeares plays. You have nodoubt <i>heard</i> of the Baconians before now, who want to make out that S. never wrote those dramas, but attribute them <i>all</i> wholesale to Francis Bacon. Bythebye that was a capital article on B in Yr April number &amp; if this new theory proves correct the author may add not a little to B's glory. Years ago this Baconian movement was<b> ¶</b>started in England. Suddenly now from across the herringpond comes new light on the subject. A W. Donelly from Mass. publishes some remarkable facts he noticed in an Edition of the first Folio. Throughout it runs a ‘Cipher’ in italic words, numbers of pages, hyphenations etc, etc, which is no mere frivolous affair but tells in its way the latter part of Bacon's live &amp; also the plots during Elizabeth's &amp; James's reigns. The former ever racked Shakespear for the truth, but Bacon managed to save the disclosure.<b> ¶</b>For fear of privacy Donelly has not yet published all his facts but in a few weeks perhaps <i>already</i>, he is in London &amp; we shall see. If you can't get the may number 19th Cent, tell me &amp; I can let you have it.<br>What about the sonnets &amp; the article you wrote? Have you sent it to London?<br>I have not yet had time to read through yr June number but anticipate much pleasure from it. I looked throug the ‘Varia’ &amp; Nederl. Politiek.<b><br>¶</b>The powers of darkness seem to be on the increase in my poor Country. Look at the Belgian Elections! 97 against 45. And here in England the Liberals &amp; Radicals have split most <i>hopelessly</i>. Even Bismarck has been obliged to eat ‘humble-pie’. Must we really expect another triumph of priest &amp; bigotry. God seems to be alive to the fact that he has lost an immense deal of prestige &amp; has evidently made up his mind to inspire his followers with some extra quantity of zeal. Damm them <i>all</i>!<b> ¶</b>I'm afraid however we shall have to fight a stiff round or two with clericalism.<br>You know I daresay, that I Cenci was produced here. Sorry to say, as I had been rather poorly the week before I had not seen the papers nor had I found an opportunity of securing seats. So I did not go. However it appears that people did not appreciate it. As a drama as expression of the poets feelings a mastercy of language it is of course simply beautyful; but why such a <i>plot</i> should be represented on a <i>stage</i> &amp; and in presence even of scores of young girls, I<b> ¶</b>fail to see the reason. This criticism has passed in several instances into personalities &amp; attacks on Shelley.<br>Don't you forget all about answering my letter this time Old boy, or I shall wire one fine afternoon.<br>Ever yours in voor- en tegenspoed.<br>J C G Grasé<br><i>Amen!</i><br>¶<br>¶<br>","annotationData":[]}},"shortName":"1886-06-14","facsimiles":[{"title":"01: Blad
