N.W.<br>5 November, 1886.<br> <br>Dr Verwey,<br>I am ashamed to own that I addressed an envelope to you a <i>fortnight</i> after I reached London. It has been reproaching me ever since. I thought of including some scrawl in yr Shakespeare; but after it had gone, there was the same woeful look about this identical envelop as before. It was maddening; so I put it away for some time. Tonight it has been<b> ¶</b>literally swearing at me for neglect of duty to a friend, far, far away! Having some leasure time at my disposal I resolved to clean myself from this lasting reproach on my fair fame. I have now fairly begun an epistle &amp; am afraid fairly filled up 2 pages with twaddle. I am glad to see that you are pleased with the reprint; but I cannot at the present moment give you any further information <i>re</i> Donelly, as nothing has transpired since of his whereabouts.<b><br>¶</b>A late apology is rather a lame sort of thing &amp; yet I cannot go on before having offered my excuses for not returning yr call before I left Amsterdam; not only as a matter of courtesy, but because I like it. However I went away at least a week before I expected to go &amp; so was obliged to give up many our[?] engagement &amp; disappointed myself very much.<br>The Nieuwe Gids is as interesting as usual to me, &amp; I am by no means sorry that<b> ¶</b>I have subscribed. I found the article on the riots very much to my taste, &amp; am glad to see that there is a reform ahead for that body. Is it going te be carried out on the lines suggested by the N.G. on the Handelsblad? I can't find any details in the English papers. I always take most interest in the political part of the magazine; because I know nothing whatever about Dutch literature, I own it to<b> ¶</b>my shame; at the same time I admire your hard work &amp; am delighted with the success yr paper continues to meet with. The views of your body are so exactly identical with mine, that I seldom differ from their doctrines. Pity that there is so little <i>pure</i> politics in our country. Here you can argue with a man on any social or political object, without being obliged to differ from him on religious opinion or<b> ¶</b>to have any such thing at all. In Holland, there are still so many people, who believe that, de vreeze des Heeren is het begin aller wijsheid, &amp; who would sooner be taught geography from the bible, than say book-keeping or read Huet. There may be great deal of bash &amp; exaggeration in the talk of ordinary English men about Russia, Constantinopel, Socialism &amp; Cambridge lectures; but there <i>is</i> more<b> ¶</b>life here than in A'dam, without the horrible curses &amp; solemn faces drown by the disputing parties in ‘kerk of staat.’<br>I just mentioned Cambridge lectures. I am not aware of any dutch paper being in the habit of chronicling Eng. literary news, but I suppose that you have heard somehow from this great cry raised by the Quarterly against Mr Gosse, the professor in English Literature at the Univ. of Cambridge. This poor fellow, a literary amateur,<b> ¶</b>has to the lasting disgrace of his University, published a book with the sanction of the fellows, on poetry from Shakespeare to Pope in which he appears to have blundered in the most elementary facts about dates &amp; authors.<br>The Quarterly devotes whole pages to mistakes in dates, in the book, about such men as Hobbes &amp; Corneille. Statements as f.i. ‘the dactyli &amp; anapaestic movements were entirely unknown to the Elizabethans’, make the book conspicuous <i>somehow</i>.<br>I shall be in Amsterdam within a fortnight. If you want anything from London, you had better let me <span data-id=\"9095067\" data-marker=\"begin\" data-type=\"verw:ann:toel\"></span>know at once.
