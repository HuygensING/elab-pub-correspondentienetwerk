The interest of no stranger can be as valuable to us as that of the only English student of Dutch literature, who is well-known among us in Amsterdam. And no one certainly is likely to feel like you interested in the literary movement from which our enterprise has originated.<br>Believe me,<br>Sir,<br>with respectful regards<br>Yours faithfully<br>Albert.
