'84<br>408 Singel<br>Amsterdam.<br><br>To the Committee for the revision of the law.<br><br>Gentlemen,<br><br>Invited by our Secretary Mr. Verbeek, to send you my propositions, I take the liberty to propose, that Rule 4 may be altered in such a manner, that in future Jews may be no more excluded from our club. I have taken this resolution, not by the debates we had lately concerning this question, but by experience.<br>    This experience has taught me that all faults, evils, bad manners and inclinations, or what name you will give it, of which the Jews are accused, and by which they are condemned to be removed from a fashionable and civillized society, equal are found among the Christians. I don't wish to admitt uncivillized or unpolished persons, but this depends quite of the members themselves.<br>    Therefor to have a better opportunity than we have now for the judgment of the qualities of proposed candidates, it would be good to demand from them an introduction of a debate. Thus I propose to alter Rule 4 and to read it as follows: <br><br><b>¶</b>Every person may be enrolled as common member, provided he has reached the age of eighteen. He must at least has been introduced twice to the society. In case he desires to become member, he shall introduce and defend a subject of debating, chosen by himself from a number of three imposed to him by the members. After this he will be proposed at the same meeting and voted upon at the next.<br><br>And Rule 5:<br><br>Any donor wishing to become a member, must express his desire to the board of Directors, and must also submit himself to the ordinary trial-debate and voting.<br><br>After having recommanded the above written things your serious consideration, I remain<br>Your truly<br>P.
