Gosse Esq<sup>re</sup> -<br><br>Sir,<br><br>Herewith I have the honor to present you with a copy of 'De Nieuwe Gids'. <br>    From the accompanying Prospectus you will learn that 'De Nieuwe Gids' is a new periodical edited by those students of litterature in Amsterdam, who cannot see their way in the Existing reviews and periodicals.<br>    They wish to realize a kind of revolution in the art and literature of their country - not only thereby to secure success for their own productions - but also to lead the tastes of their countrymen to the English poets, who have been their models for several years. -<br>                     <b>¶</b>    Because they could not carry out this without as much assistance, as they could contrive to find - they sought and found in this country men of science, of art and of politics, who were ready to lend their aid.<br>    The first number of 'De Nieuwe Gids' is the result of their combined efforts.<br>    And now I hope you will excuse the liberty, with which I draw your attention to a copy of this new periodical. The interest of no stranger can be to us as valuable as that of the only English student of Dutch litterature we have heard of and no one certainly is likely to feel so much interested in the litterary movement, from which our enterprise is originated.<br><br>Believe me, Sir,<br>With respectful regards<br>Yours faithfully<br>Albert.Verwey<br>","annotationData":[]}},"shortName":"1885-10-01","facsimiles":[{"title":"01: Blad 1","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4594_0004.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4594_0004.jp2"},{"title":"02: Blad 2","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4594_0003.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4594_0003.jp2"}],"metadata":[{"field":"Afzender(s)","value":"Verwey, Albert"},{"field":"Ontvanger(s)","value":"Gosse, Edmund William"},{"field":"Plaats","value":"Amsterdam"},{"field":"Datum","value":"1885-10-01"},{"field":"Annotatie","value":"Concept"},{"field":"Taal","value":"Engels"},{"field":"Bijlage(n)","value":""},{"field":"Transcriptie","value":"Diplomatisch"},{"field":"Herkomst transcriptie","value":"Kets e.a."},{"field":"Bewaarplaats","value":"Bijzondere Collecties UvA, Amsterdam"},{"field":"Collectie","value":"Collectie Albert Verwey"},{"field":"Signatuur","value":"XLI B 4594"}]}
