It has been most gracious of you to keep us such a long time especially as I am perfectly aware to be a very poor society man indeed. I think it must have been for the sake of my wife who is always trying her best to make much good where<strong>¶</strong>I am failing. Of course it is to me an enormous handicap on account of my deafness not to be able to follow the conversation, but I have to accept my fate, seeming to be a tedious and dull fellow, and I quite agree with everybody who is of that opinion.<br>I have, in fact, to apologize for going in society at all, but the invitation of Sir William was so very kind and we both like him so very much, that in accepting I hoped you might excuse me. Besides I had the<strong>¶</strong>wish to be of some use and that is why I painted the portrait of your charming daughter in law, and feel so gratefull and awfully glad Sir William likes it, though I am sure the praises I heard are very much exagerated.<br>I should be exceedingly sorry if circumstances would not allow me to come back and see you again. We are sailing Saturday next but as soon as we arrive in Amsterdam I will write to Sir William.<br>Would you be so kind to remember us to your family and guests?<br> <strong>¶</strong>With our best wishes and kindest regards to all of you, from both my wife &amp; myself<br>most sincerely yours<br><i>Willem Witsen</i>.<br><br>Amsterdam<br>Oosterpark 82","annotationData":[]}},"shortName":"1915-08-19","facsimiles":[{"title":"01: Blad 1","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_001_X-1.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_001_X-1.jp2"},{"title":"02: Blad 2","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_002_X-0.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_002_X-0.jp2"},{"title":"03: Blad 3","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_002_X-1.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_002_X-1.jp2"},{"title":"04: Blad 4","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_001_X-0.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/witsen/WITS01_KB75C51-WIT12_001_X-0.jp2"}],"metadata":[{"field":"Afzender(s)","value":"Witsen, Willem Arnoldus"},{"field":"Ontvanger(s)","value":"Hurd, Doris Lucy Adeline"},{"field":"Plaats","value":"New York"},{"field":"Datum","value":"1915-08-19"},{"field":"Annotatie","value":""},{"field":"Taal","value":"Engels"},{"field":"Bijlage(n)","value":""},{"field":"Transcriptie","value":"Kritisch"},{"field":"Herkomst transcriptie","value":"SWW"},{"field":"Bewaarplaats","value":"Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Den Haag"},{"field":"Collectie","value":"Collectie Witsen"},{"field":"Signatuur","value":"KW 75 C 51"}]}
