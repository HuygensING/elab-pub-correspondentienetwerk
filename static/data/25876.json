But I don't believe such things are of great consequence, if the reader sees &amp; feels the poet's images. And yet people say, I'm only a master of the form &amp; my contents are but very poor! As a poet I have no higher ambition than to have good things well written so that the reader &amp; I may enjoy ourselves. And I am only so very sorry that I find such a few good things &amp; that it is so difficult to write well. A man writes well if he writes what he feels &amp; nothing more. Multatuli says: Be honest - that's all. Very often it is difficult to be honest in writing because <b>¶</b>you must write <u>feelings</u> as well as <u>thoughts</u> &amp; a man wants a good deal of what you, English, call <u>taste</u> to find out which word is the proper one to express what he feels - - Now, while writing those words, I felt that I did not wholly express what I meant - I could not be honest - it would be difficult at least.<br>    A good deal of home-virtues, I cannot agree with - neither you, I believe - for they are backed by no reason at all. But: thou shalt not lie! that's right, I maintain. A man who lies changes circumstances &amp; whether that be good &amp; profitable or not, if there is only once more a crossing of those circumstances, that crossing <b>¶</b>will show that the line is no longer straight.<br>    I dwell on this topic rather long, because I think it is the corrupted [root?] of life in our country. Ministers of State lie, Members of Parliament lie, Professors &amp; lectors lie, preachers lie, papers lie, poets lie, merchants lie &amp; there is no crossing of circumstances but you can see that they have been tortured out of their true form - This is bad &amp; Grasé, I believe there is much to do in Holland for those who have the feeling of right &amp; the power to stand in a storm.<br>    Always when I have told a lie I am very sad<b>.<br>    ¶</b>My letter is quite a confession, but never mind! You see I am writing on the paper you sent me. I do never see Lamsvelt.<br>    Please inform me of the price you paid for it then I will remitt it to London. I am not going to America, June 1885 I will pass my first examination (Eindex Gymnasium). - There is not much to say about Entertainment - it was good, but not splendid. My speech about Byron pleased them sure enough - but it did not please <u>me</u>; of course, for I spoke nonsense. In the meetings they make [noise?] about revision rules &amp; can't get ready. They made me Asst-Secy but I have refused. I have not been there for two weeks.<br>    I will write more,<br><br>Yrs very truly<br>Albert Verwey.<br>","annotationData":[]}},"shortName":"1885-06-XX","facsimiles":[{"title":"01: Blad 1","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0001.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0001.jp2"},{"title":"02: Blad 2","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0002.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0002.jp2"},{"title":"03: Blad 3","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0003.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0003.jp2"},{"title":"04: Blad 4","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0004.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB9/UBAHSXLIB9710_0004.jp2"}],"metadata":[{"field":"Afzender(s)","value":"Verwey, Albert"},{"field":"Ontvanger(s)","value":"Grasé, Jan Carl Gijsbert"},{"field":"Plaats","value":"Onbekend"},{"field":"Datum","value":"1885-06-XX"},{"field":"Annotatie","value":"Blijkens de aanspreking op blad 3 is de brief gericht aan J.C.G.
