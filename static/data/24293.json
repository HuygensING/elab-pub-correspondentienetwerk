N-W.<br>15 February '87<br> <br>Dear Verwey,<br>I have not had anything to write to you, so I have not bothered you or myself with nonsense. I enclose a piece of critisism!! on Dowden Shelley, fom which you may gather some information.<br>I did not succeed in my application for Leiden &amp; am again disappointed with Middelburg, but I believe in Bruce with the spider.<br>Nil desperandum!<br>Latin, you see. I am getting on<b> ¶</b>with my study of that tongue &amp; the merely mastering rudimentary knowledge like it very much. I always have preferred phonology &amp; language-study to the real study of literature. I can't help myself &amp; don't believe any of the nonsense, written about <i>cultivating</i> taste. Such humbug. I'll stick to <i>my</i> particular liking, comparative grammar is <i>my</i> delight.<br>As I know your views on <i>sound</i> &amp; its meaning I copy here<b> ¶</b>a peculiar piece of american ‘bash’, which I trust may give you as much amusement as it did to me: The Jabberwocky.<br><br>Beware the Jabberwock, my son, The jaws that bite, the claws that catch.<br>Beware the jub-jub-bird &amp; shun, The fumious Bandersnatch!<br> <br>He took his vorpal sword in hand And 'long the monsome road he sought.<br>He rested by the tum-tum tree And stood awhile in thought.<br> <br>And as in uffish thoughts he stood, The jabberwock with eyes of flame<br>Came whiffling up the tulgy wood And burbled as he came.<br> <br>One two, one two, &amp; through &amp; through His vorpal blade went snickersnack.<br>He left him dead &amp; with his head, He came galumphing back.<br> <br>And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>O, pranjious day! Caloo, Calaa! He chortled in his joy!<br><br>If you read this aloud &amp; don't fancy that you understand some of it. If you can't see him <i>galumphing</i> back &amp; appreciate the <i>beamish</i>, I am much mistaken. Believe me Ever Yrs sincerly<br>J C G Grasé.<br>","annotationData":[]}},"shortName":"1887-02-15","facsimiles":[{"title":"01: Blad 1","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4660_0002.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4660_0002.jp2"},{"title":"02: Blad 2","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4660_0001.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4660_0001.jp2"},{"title":"03: Blad 3","thumbnail":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/resolver?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&svc_id=info:lanl-repo/svc/getRegion&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:jpeg2000&svc.format=image/jpeg&svc.level=1&rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4660_0003.jp2","zoom":"https://tomcat.tiler01.huygens.knaw.nl/adore-djatoka/viewer2.1.html?rft_id=http://localhost:8080/jp2/verwey/UBAHSXLIB4/UBAHSXLIB4660_0003.jp2"}],"metadata":[{"field":"Afzender(s)","value":"Grasé, Jan Carl Gijsbert"},{"field":"Ontvanger(s)","value":"Verwey, Albert"},{"field":"Plaats","value":"Londen"},{"field":"Datum","value":"1887-02-15"},{"field":"Annotatie","value":"Plaats ontleend aan adres afzender (OPC)"},{"field":"Taal","value":"Engels"},{"field":"Bijlage(n)","value":""},{"field":"Transcriptie","value":"Kritisch"},{"field":"Herkomst transcriptie","value":"S&vdW"},{"field":"Bewaarplaats","value":"Bijzondere Collecties UvA, Amsterdam"},{"field":"Collectie","value":"Collectie Albert Verwey"},{"field":"Signatuur","value":"XLI B 4660"}]}
