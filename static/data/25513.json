Soc<sup>y</sup>.<br>Amsterdam.<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>Though I have ceased to be a member of your Society I deem it my duty to send you a few lines in answer to your official letter of the 15th inst: -<br>    Allow me, however, first of all to correct a little mistake in said letter, viz - where you have written the word <u>unanimously</u>. I, who was not present at the voting, can tell you that there were <u>at least</u> <u>two</u> members present who did not give any sign of approval.<br>    But now to what I had to say in answer.<br>    It has been my intention to write a <b>¶</b>little private note to Mr Mac Farlane, begging Excuse for interrupting him - an unvoluntary act of unpoliteness, which in civil society is always to be followed by a conciliating: I beg your pardon, Sir! - and another private note to Mr Gaveel, making apology for my breaking of 'usance, etiquette and decorum', which, I know, Mr Gaveel would excuse the more freely as he himself is not one of the ever-cool-tempered class.<br>    Mr Gaveel has spoken <u>for</u> me while I was absent - I knew, he would do so; as well as I knew that there were many among the members too narrow-hearted to conceive such impartiality.<br>    And therewith I speak about the Society generally. When I first became a member, I felt glad at the thought what a great deal of good could be done by such a Society, with members seemingly so full of enthusiasm for their good <b>¶</b>cause, with a President so zealously inclined to make it flourish and prosper in no common degree. And then, I did as much as I could do with little time and little knowledge of club-affairs to be no useless member of this club. - In the beginning, indeed, I saw already that the members had not yet come to a common understanding of the principles the Society ought to be based upon. But then I hoped that, by a <u>temporary</u> concentration of all power in the President and the B. of Directors, - only opposed by the power of the Meeting to alter the rules <u>whenever</u> <u>necessary</u> - that spirit of association would come.<br>    Privately I urged strongly on Mr Gaveel not to lay down the Presidency - as a member of the Committee for the Rules I followed the same system in trying to make the number of members more limited and to give more power to the members of the Board of Directors. - <b>¶</b>By following this scheme I felt sure of success - of success in a very short time.<br>    And is it then not a sorry sight to see such irresolution as was shown during the debate about our law - even so that what was rejected <u>unanimously</u> only five minutes ago, was put in another form and adopted as the lost son in the parable?<br>    And perhaps you don't know - nor know many of the members - how painful and loath &amp; awe it is to hear nonsense spoken with an earnest face and what is faulty and ridiculous held up as The Holy Gospel. Do you yet believe that there is anything more necessary to explain both absence and conduct?<br><br><span data-id=\"9091173\" data-marker=\"begin\" data-type=\"verw:ann:toel\"></span>Those were the means by which I strove to execute a great plan of  reformation, which chiefly intended to make every member become  interested in the whole organization &amp; useful, every one in his own  way. But here it is not necessary to develop those views.<br>    In  taking leave I can give nothing but my best wishes for the wellfare of  your Society but I would I had a stronger belief in its prosperity than I  have now. -<sup data-id=\"9091173\" data-marker=\"end\">1</sup><br><br><br>","annotationData":[{"annotatedText":"Those were the means by which I strove to execute a great plan of  reformation, which chiefly intended to make every member become  interested in the whole organization &amp; useful, every one in his own  way.
